# Token Burn Mechanism

## Project Description

The **Token Burn Mechanism** is a decentralized token built on the Ethereum blockchain that implements a burn mechanism during each transaction. A percentage of tokens are burned every time a transfer is made, reducing the total supply and creating a deflationary effect. This project demonstrates how to integrate a burn feature into an ERC-20 token contract.

Each time a transfer is executed, a fixed percentage of the transferred tokens is burned, removing them from circulation and lowering the total supply.

## Smart Contract Address

The deployed smart contract for this project can be found at the following address:

**Contract Address**: [0x323CE8025d984AD25d583053beFB555DF8641B1C](https://etherscan.io/address/0x323CE8025d984AD25d583053beFB555DF8641B1C)

## Features

- **Deflationary Mechanism**: A percentage of tokens are burned during every transfer, reducing the total supply over time.
- **ERC-20 Standard**: Follows the ERC-20 standard for token transfers, approvals, and allowances.
- **Simple and Efficient**: The contract is designed to be lightweight, with no unnecessary imports or complex features.

## Installation

To use the token, simply deploy the contract to an Ethereum-compatible network like Ethereum mainnet, testnet (Rinkeby, Ropsten), or any other Ethereum-compatible network.

### Requirements

- Solidity Compiler (0.8.x or higher)
- Ethereum Wallet (MetaMask or similar)
- Ethereum Network (Mainnet or Testnet)

## Usage

Once deployed, users can interact with the token by transferring, approving, and burning tokens. Each transfer will automatically burn a percentage of the transferred tokens as defined in the smart contract.

For example, the contract burns **2%** of every token transfer.

## Example Transfer

```solidity
contract TokenBurnMechanism {
    // Example of how to perform transfers with burn mechanism
    token.transfer(toAddress, amount); // 2% burn happens automatically during the transfer
}
```

## Contract Source Code

The source code for the contract is available in this repository. You can clone this repo and deploy the contract on your own Ethereum-compatible network.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/token-burn-mechanism.git
cd token-burn-mechanism
```
